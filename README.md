# CarbonTrackr - Carbon Footprint Tracker

## Overview
CarbonTrackr is a minimal proof-of-concept web application that helps users track and offset their carbon footprint based on their travel data. The application calculates the carbon footprint and provides AI-generated recommendations to reduce emissions.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, TypeScript, Vite
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **UI Library**: Shadcn
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Features
- **Carbon Footprint Calculator**: Users can input their travel details (mode, distance, fuel type, passengers) to calculate their carbon footprint.
- **AI Recommendations**: The system generates recommendations to help users reduce their carbon emissions.
- **Local Storage**: All calculations and recommendations are stored using Zustand for persistence.
- **Minimal UI**: The focus is on functionality rather than aesthetics.

## Installation & Setup
